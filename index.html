<h4>After completing my bachelor’s degree in engineering, I got into a construction company as a site

responsibility to overlook multiple projects which I completed with minimum resources and
maximum efficiency. As a Site engineer, I had to Schedule the project, manage resources crash
the project to meet the deadline, manage lot of people and deal with them effectively and
obtain the best results. All of the projects were going at the same time and I had to put up a
great effort to manage and coordinate every activity for maximum quality, optimum cost and
optimum duration. Although a big project, resource and material was scarce so it had to be
analyzed allocated and levelled for the efficient and uninterrupted progress of the project. By
analyzing the progress of the projects and allocating resources based on the requirements I was
able to complete the project with minimum resources and maximum efficiency. During the one-
year period I had great improvement in my project management skills and was Promoted as
the project engineer. As a project engineer, I had responsibility over multiple project and my
duty was of managerial character. I coordinated the entire project, discussing the progress

the project to deliver projects within agreed timeframes. I monitored progress and after
analyzing, I organized meeting with the supervisors and notified current shortcomings and
methods to improve the efficiency of the project. I made sure all the projects are on time. And
made frequent presentations on the progress of the project to my superiors.</h4>
